		"Hi, my name is Christian, but my friends call me &#34;Joker&#34;. Feel free to do the same. But I need to tell you that I&#39;m bad at telling jokes.\n\nI discovered my passion for programming when I was 9 after my father gave away my beloved dog. To honor his memory, I built a website filled with pictures of him. That&#39;s where my love affair with coding began. During high school, I took several graphic design courses and developed a strong interest also in UI design.\n\nIn my previous role as a consultant, I specialized in developing custom web applications. There, I had the opportunity to work for big companies across various industries like automotive, tourism, airlines, robotics, and medicine. After years of experience in large corporations, I&#39;ve ventured into freelance work.\n\nI would love to hear from you and discuss our next project!",
