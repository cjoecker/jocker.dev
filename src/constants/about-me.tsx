    <Paragraph>
      ...but my friends call me "Joker".
      Feel free to do the same. But I need to tell you that I'm bad at telling
      jokes.

    <Paragraph>
      I discovered my passion for programming when I was 9 after my father gave
      away my beloved dog. To honor his memory, I built a website filled with
      pictures of him. That's where my love affair with coding began. During
      high school, I took several graphic design courses and developed a
      strong interest also in UI design.

      In my previous role as a consultant, I specialized in developing custom
      web applications. There, I had the opportunity to work for big companies
      across various industries like automotive, tourism, airlines, robotics,
      and medicine. Unfortunately, my previous projects were confidential.
      That's why I don't have a portfolio here yet. After years of experience in
      large corporations, I've ventured into freelance work.

      I have a wide range of interests and enjoy learning about various
      subjects. This broad knowledge base allows me to take an integrative
      approach to my work and always keep the big picture in mind. I am also a
      firm believer in the importance of helping others, and I always make time
      for it. My goal is not only to meet your needs but to exceed your
      expectations with a touch of extra flair and creativity.
